## What is goElectron?
Electron microscopy Monte Carlo simulation code using the go language.

## Goals

<!--Provide a functional interface that closely represents the AMQP 0.9.1 model
targeted to RabbitMQ as a server.  This includes the minimum necessary to
interact the semantics of the protocol.-->

## Usage

<!--See the 'examples' subdirectory for simple producers and consumers executables.
If you have a use-case in mind which isn't well-represented by the examples,
please file an issue.-->

## Documentation

<!--Use [Godoc documentation](http://godoc.org/github.com/streadway/amqp) for
reference and usage.

[RabbitMQ tutorials in
Go](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-tutorials/tree/master/go) are also
available.-->
